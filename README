Photoroid
---------

Photoroid is a dead-simple web application for sharing pictures. It was
designed to be used by non-advanced users. Photoroid has the following features
that set it appart from other solutions such as Piwigo, Flickr, Dropbox or
Picasa.

- Album sharing through private URLs.
- No account creation required for non-album administrators.
- No desktop application required.
- One-click album download.
- No space limitation, since you can host it on your own server.

Install
-------

  git clone https://github.com/regisb/photoroid.git && cd photoroid
  bundle install --path vendor/cache && rake db:migrate
  rails server

Now head over at http://0.0.0.0:3000 to see the application in action.

You might want to limit album creation to certain users. To do so, edit the
app/models/user.rb file and add the authorized email addresses to the
whitelist. Not very intuitive, but it works.

Limitations
-----------

Photoroid currently misses some important features:

- Album download seems to be broken on Windows whenever the album name contains
  non ASCII characters.
- The GUI is awful.
- Image display is synchronous, so that albums that contain many images may
  take a long time to load.
- Zip file archives are never deleted.
- Zip file archives are re-created every time a user clicks on "Download album".
- Password reset links do not expire.
- Image may be displayed with the wrong orientation.

Photoroid is not a finished application yet, but I decided to release it
because 1) It works 2) It would greatly benefit from exterior comments.

Open Source

I am mightily open to contributions! This code is copyrighted under the terms
of the Apache License, v2.0</a> and I would be glad to add your name to the
list of contributors. In particular, I am looking forward to comments on my
Rails code and contributions from web designer to improve the CSS and the
general layout of the application.
